# Code Supplement for Bayesian Analysis

I have prepared code for running the Fast Beta Linkage (fabl) method to accompany our submission to Bayesian Analysis. The required functions are stored in the *R* folder, and they can be loaded by selecting **Build -> Load All** from the top menu of RStudio.

A computing cluster is required to run the entire simulations in reasonable time, but you can easily run individual simulations on a personal computer. 

Data for the National Long Term Care Study (NLTCS) and El Salvador human rights data are restricted, and therefore not included here.
