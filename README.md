# Code Supplement for Bayesian Analysis

I prepared code for running the Fast Beta Linkage (\texttt{fabl}) method, and code to run the simulation studies. A computing cluster is required to run the entire simulations in reasonable time, but you can easily run individual simulations on a personal computer. 

Data for the National Long Term Care Study (NLTCS) and El Salvador human rights data are restricted, and therefore not included here.
